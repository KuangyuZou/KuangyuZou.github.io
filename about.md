Hi, my name is Kuangyu Zou, and you can also call me Connie. I was born in Guangzhou, China, and graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2024. Iâ€™m currently a graduate student in the MEng program in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University.

Throughout both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have focused extensively on data science. I am passionate about using big data technologies to help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions. My ultimate goal is to become a professional data scientist who bridges analytics with real-world impact.
