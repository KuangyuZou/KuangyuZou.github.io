## Project Brief Summary
During my October 2023–March 2024 capstone project, I developed a robust credit‑scoring pipeline on over 100,000 bank transactions. 
I began by cleaning the data—handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates—to ensure integrity and modeling readiness. 
Next, I applied TF‑IDF to extract meaningful features from transaction descriptions and engineered an additional 132 features based on users’ income, account balance, transaction types, and banking details. 
Finally, I trained and compared logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost classifiers, achieving an AUC of 87%, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of loan‑approval decisions.
