## Introduction
Hello! I’m Kuangyu “Connie” Zou, a Master of Engineering student in Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. 
I graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2024 with a double major in Data Science and Applied Mathematics (overall GPA 3.554/4.0). Over the past year I’ve partnered with Netgear and Cornell Engineering on a data‑analysis apprenticeship, where I built ETL pipelines to process over 600,000 product records and applied ARIMA forecasting to reduce inventory error below 5%, driving nearly $1 million in incremental revenue. 
Prior to that, I interned at Shepherd Ventures as a Quantitative Analyst, designing MVO and MVO‑DB portfolio strategies that preserved 35.8% of capital during market downturns and delivered consistent 2% monthly alpha.

I bring hands‑on experience across the analytics lifecycle—from data wrangling and visualization in Python/R to machine‑learning modeling and A/B testing for business insights.
During a capstone project I engineered a 132‑feature credit‑scoring model using TF‑IDF, logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost to achieve an 87% AUC. In another engagement, I analyzed 23,000 airline reviews with NLP and optimized an ElasticNet model (MSE 4.22) to guide customer‑experience improvements. My core technical toolkit includes SQL, Spark, PyTorch, Tableau, and Power BI, and I’m passionate about leveraging data ethics and privacy to drive responsible, data‑driven decision making. 
I’m now seeking opportunities where I can combine deep quantitative skills with strategic problem solving to deliver measurable impact.
